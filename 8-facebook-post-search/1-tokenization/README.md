# Tensor

A **tensor** is a generalization of a **vector** and a **matrix**, and it is not the same as a vector. Here‚Äôs how they differ:

### **1. Vector**:
- A vector is a 1-dimensional array of numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
- It is often used to represent data points or features in space.
- Mathematically, a vector can be thought of as a 1D tensor.

### **2. Matrix**:
- A matrix is a 2-dimensional array of numbers (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]]).
- It has rows and columns, and it's often used to represent transformations or datasets.
- Mathematically, a matrix is a 2D tensor.

### **3. Tensor**:
- A tensor is a more generalized concept that can represent arrays of any number of dimensions.
  - **0D tensor**: Scalar (e.g., 5).
  - **1D tensor**: Vector (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
  - **2D tensor**: Matrix (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]]).
  - **3D tensor**: Array of matrices (e.g., [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]).
  - **nD tensor**: Tensors can have more than 3 dimensions, which are used in deep learning for storing data like images, videos, or even higher-dimensional data.

### **Summary**:
- A **vector** is a 1-dimensional tensor.
- A **matrix** is a 2-dimensional tensor.
- A **tensor** can have any number of dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D, etc.).

In essence, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays (like those used in deep learning) are all specific cases of tensors, and a tensor can be thought of as a container for data that generalizes both vectors and matrices.

# N-grams

### What are n-grams?

Imagine you have a sentence made of blocks (words), like:

> "I love ice cream"

Now, if you just look at **one block at a time**, that‚Äôs called a **unigram**:
- "I", "love", "ice", "cream"

If you look at **two blocks stuck together**, that‚Äôs a **bigram**:
- "I love", "love ice", "ice cream"

If you look at **three blocks stuck together**, that‚Äôs a **trigram**:
- "I love ice", "love ice cream"

Basically:
- **n-gram** = **n words stuck together**.

---

### Why do we even use n-grams?

Because when we look at *pairs* or *triples* of words, we understand better what people mean.
- "ice cream" makes a lot of sense together.
- Just "ice" and "cream" separately might miss that connection.

---

### So what‚Äôs the problem with n-grams?

**1. Too Many Combinations!**
- The number of possible n-grams **explodes** when your text gets bigger.
- Imagine you have 10,000 words ‚Äî there are **millions** of possible bigrams and trillions of trigrams!
- Most of these will either:
  - Never happen at all
  - Happen only once
  - Waste a lot of space

**2. Data Gets Very Sparse**
- Because there are so many possible combinations, and most don't show up, the data becomes very **empty** ("sparse").
- Sparse data is hard for computers to work with efficiently.

**3. No Deep Understanding**
- N-grams only know *next to each other* relationships.
- They don‚Äôt *understand* the meaning.
  - Example: "I **love** ice cream" vs. "I **hate** ice cream" ‚Äî both have "ice cream", but feelings are different.
  - N-grams don't catch that ‚Äî they just see word patterns.

**4. Doesn't Handle New Sentences Well**
- If a new sentence has a word combo the model hasn‚Äôt seen before, it gets confused.
- Example: "frozen yogurt" ‚Äî if the model only knows "ice cream", it might not know what to do.

### Summary

| N-grams Good For | N-grams Bad For |
|:-----------------|:----------------|
| Simple, small texts | Huge texts (combinatorial explosion) |
| Local word connections | Deep meaning |
| Quick tricks like autocomplete | Generalizing to new phrases |

Awesome question. Let's break it down **simply and clearly**:

---

# Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)

- Word2Vec takes **each word** and turns it into a **fixed-size vector** (a list of numbers, like `[0.2, -1.3, 0.7, ...]`).
- Similar words end up with **similar vectors**.
  - "king" and "queen" are close.
  - "cat" and "dog" are close.
- **BUT**: Each word always has **one meaning**.
  - "bank" (money place) and "bank" (river bank) are treated the **same**. Word2Vec can't tell the difference based on context.
- **Simple**: Word2Vec = One vector per word. Forever.

---

# Transformers (BERT, GPT)

- Transformers are much **smarter**.
- They **read entire sentences** and understand **context**.
  - "bank" in "money bank" and "bank" in "river bank" are **different**.
- They produce a **different vector for the same word** depending on the **sentence**.
- Transformers don't just give you one vector per word ‚Äî they can give a whole **vector per word per sentence**.

And they can **generate** text (like me ‚ú®), **understand** meaning, and even **answer questions** because they model **relationships between all words together**.

# Short Summary

| | Word2Vec | Transformers (BERT, GPT) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Handles meaning of words? | Yes (basic) | Yes (and understands context) |
| Different meaning for same word? | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Reads full sentences? | ‚ùå (word-by-word) | ‚úÖ (full attention) |
| Generates text? | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Complexity | Simple | Complex but powerful |

---

# Super Quick Visual:

**Word2Vec:**  
"cat" ‚Üí [vector]  
"dog" ‚Üí [vector]  
"bank" ‚Üí [vector] (same always)

**Transformer:**  
"I went to the river **bank**" ‚Üí [contextual vector for 'bank']  
"I deposited cash at the **bank**" ‚Üí [different contextual vector for 'bank']

Would you like me to also draw a fun diagram to show how **bigram explosion** happens visually? üöÄ (it‚Äôs kinda fun!)
Would you like me to show you a **real tiny example** of how Word2Vec vs BERT would encode a word like "apple"? üçé (it's super cool!) üöÄ
