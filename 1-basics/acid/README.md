Here’s a concise **README** that covers **isolation levels** and briefly introduces **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, and **Durability** (together known as the ACID properties):

# **README: Isolation Levels and ACID Properties**

## **1. Introduction**

In relational database systems, **ACID** properties ensure that transactions are processed reliably. These properties are **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**. Among these, **Isolation** is particularly concerned with the visibility and concurrency of transactions. The **isolation level** defines how transaction integrity is maintained and what kind of interference is allowed between concurrent transactions.

This README will explain the different **isolation levels**, and briefly touch on **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, and **Durability**.

## **2. ACID Properties**

### **Atomicity**
- **Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit, which either completes entirely or doesn't affect the database at all.
- If a transaction is interrupted (due to a crash, for example), the system will revert the database back to its state before the transaction started. This is also known as **rollback**.
  
### **Consistency**
- **Consistency** guarantees that a transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another.
- After a transaction, the database must always be in a consistent state, adhering to all constraints, rules, and relationships.

### **Durability**
- **Durability** ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes made to the database are permanent, even if there’s a system failure.
- Committed data will survive crashes, power losses, and other types of failures.

## **3. Isolation Levels**

The **Isolation Level** defines how the changes made in a transaction are visible to other transactions during the execution. There are four primary isolation levels, each providing a different balance between consistency and performance:

### **1. READ UNCOMMITTED**
- **Description**: This is the lowest isolation level.
- **Behavior**: Transactions can **read dirty data** (uncommitted changes) from other transactions.
- **Concurrency**: Allows maximum concurrency but can lead to **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, and **phantom reads**.
- **Use Case**: Best for cases where performance is more important than absolute accuracy (e.g., analytics).

#### **Example Issues**:
- **Dirty Reads**: Transaction A writes data, and Transaction B reads it before A commits. If A rolls back, B has read invalid data.

---

### **2. READ COMMITTED**
- **Description**: The default isolation level in many databases (including PostgreSQL and Oracle).
- **Behavior**: Transactions can only **read committed data** from other transactions.
- **Concurrency**: Prevents dirty reads but still allows **non-repeatable reads** (i.e., data read by one transaction can change if another commits).
- **Use Case**: Used when you want to avoid dirty reads but can tolerate some level of inconsistency (e.g., financial reports where slight inconsistencies are acceptable).

#### **Example Issues**:
- **Non-repeatable Reads**: A transaction reads data, but another transaction commits changes to the same data, causing different results in subsequent reads.

---

### **3. REPEATABLE READ**
- **Description**: This isolation level prevents **non-repeatable reads**.
- **Behavior**: Transactions can only read data that was committed at the start of the transaction and any subsequent reads will see the same value.
- **Concurrency**: Ensures repeatable reads, but it still allows **phantom reads** (where new rows can appear in the result set between reads in the same transaction).
- **Use Case**: Ideal for transactions that require high consistency and can tolerate moderate performance overhead (e.g., banking systems).

#### **Example Issues**:
- **Phantom Reads**: A transaction reads a set of rows, but another transaction inserts or deletes rows that would match the same query, creating a different result.

---

### **4. SERIALIZABLE**
- **Description**: The highest isolation level.
- **Behavior**: Ensures that transactions are **serializable**, meaning they execute as if one transaction is happening at a time, even if they are run concurrently.
- **Concurrency**: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads by effectively serializing the transactions.
- **Use Case**: Used when the highest level of consistency is required and performance is not a concern (e.g., when processing sensitive data or performing critical business operations).

#### **Example Issues**:
- **Blocking**: Since it enforces a strict order, transactions can block each other, resulting in decreased performance and concurrency.

## **4. Comparison of Isolation Levels**

| **Isolation Level**   | **Dirty Reads** | **Non-repeatable Reads** | **Phantom Reads** | **Performance Impact** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **READ UNCOMMITTED**   | Allowed         | Allowed                  | Allowed           | Highest                |
| **READ COMMITTED**     | Not Allowed     | Allowed                  | Allowed           | Medium                 |
| **REPEATABLE READ**    | Not Allowed     | Not Allowed              | Allowed           | High                   |
| **SERIALIZABLE**       | Not Allowed     | Not Allowed              | Not Allowed       | Lowest                 |

## **5. Choosing the Right Isolation Level**

When deciding which isolation level to use, consider the trade-offs between **performance** and **data consistency**:

- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Use this level only if absolute accuracy isn’t necessary and performance is crucial.
- **READ COMMITTED**: Suitable for systems where consistency is important but some level of inaccuracy (non-repeatable reads) is acceptable.
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Choose this when repeatable data is needed but phantom reads are not critical.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Best for systems that require **absolute consistency** and can tolerate low concurrency (e.g., in banking, high-value transactions).

---

## **6. Conclusion**

Isolation levels provide varying degrees of concurrency and consistency control for database transactions. By choosing the right isolation level, you can achieve the desired balance between **data integrity** and **system performance**.

For best practice:
- Start with **READ COMMITTED** in most situations, as it provides a good balance.
- Use **REPEATABLE READ** or **SERIALIZABLE** when you need strict consistency.
- Choose **READ UNCOMMITTED** only when you need maximum throughput and can tolerate some inconsistency.
